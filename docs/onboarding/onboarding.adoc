This documentation contains walkthroughs and resources that will help you setup your local development
environment which enables local UI, CLI and mobile services development.

[[dev-env-setup]]
== Development Environment Setup

An OpenShift environment needs to be setup with the mobile applications and services available, 
which enables local UI, CLI and mobile services (via APBs) development.
There are two options on how to do this:

. Using the *installer*.
  * Follow this link:../walkthroughs/local-setup.adoc[documentation] to setup your development environment using the installer.
. Using *minishift*.
  * Follow this link:https://github.com/aerogear/minishift-mobilecore-addon/blob/master/README.md[documentation] to setup your development environment using minishift.

[[cli-setup]]
== CLI Setup & Development

The Mobile CLI contains a list of commands that allows you to interact with your local Openshift environment.
It can be used standalone or as a kubectl/oc plugin. 

Follow this link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-cli/blob/master/README.md[documentation] to setup the CLI locally.
