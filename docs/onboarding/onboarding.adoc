This documentation contains walkthroughs and resources that will help you setup your local development
environment which enables local UI, CLI and mobile services development.

An OpenShift environment needs to be setup with the mobile applications and services available, 
which enables local UI, CLI and mobile services (via APBs) development. Complete the steps that describe setting up Mobile Services at:

[[cli-setup]]
== CLI Setup & Development

The Mobile CLI contains a list of commands that allows you to interact with your local Openshift environment.
It can be used standalone or as a kubectl/oc plugin. 

Follow this link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-cli/blob/master/README.md[documentation] to setup the CLI locally.
