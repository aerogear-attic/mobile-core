Developing APBs Locally
-----------------------

The document is documenting best practises for the Aerogear APB development! Some general information about the OpenShift Ansible Broker (OAB) & Ansible Playbook Bundles (APB) can be found link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/architecture/service_catalog/ansible_service_broker.html[here].

## Installation

The `apb` CLI can be installed locally, _however_ it is highly recommended using it wrapped in a Linux container. Below is an example on how to create an alias for the _wrapped_`apb` CLI:

....
alias apb='docker run --rm --privileged -v $PWD:/mnt -v $HOME/.kube:/.kube -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -u $UID docker.io/ansibleplaybookbundle/apb-tools'
....


## Creating an APB

There is a link:https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/ansible-playbook-bundle/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md[great tutorial] on how to write ABPs, it's highly recommended going through that!

_NOTE:_ It's a good practise to have the APB end with `-apb`!


### Create a Makefile

Until link:https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/ansible-playbook-bundle/pull/149[this PR] gets merged, it is highly recommended to create a `Makefile`, like link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerogearcatalog/fh-sync-server-apb/master/Makefile[here]:

### Local Build

With the `Makefile` in place, run a _local_ build like:

....
make apb_build
....

### Pushing to Dockerhub

If you want to push the _APB_ to your own Dockerhub account, run the following, to run a _complete_ build:

....
make DOCKERORG="my_org"
....

_NOTE:_ With `DOCKERHOST` you can also override the dockerhost; default is `docker.io`.

### Locally pushing APBs to OpenShift Ansible Broker (OAB)

#### Setup of MCP

Create a MCP cluster pointing at your own docker organisation, this will also copy all the existing APBs in aerogear to the dockerhub_org:
....
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e "dockerhub_username=<dockerusername>" -e "dockerhub_password=<dockerpassword>" -e "dockerhub_org=<USE_THIS_VALUE>" -e "apb_sync=true" --ask-become-pass
....

#### Push to ASB

Once you have issued the (local) build, you can push your ABP to the running ASB of your MCP projct:

....
apb push
....

Afterwards your APB is ready to be used from the _Service Catalog_.

## Best Practises

### Mobile-Service Tag

For MCP enabled _APBs_, make sure we have a `mobile-service` tag inside the `apb.yml` file:

....
...
tags: 
  - mobile-service
....

### ServiceName label

Inside of the `apb.yml` file, make sure you use the `serviceName:` label, like:

....
...
metadata:
  displayName: Aerogear Sync Server
  console.openshift.io/iconClass: icon-nodejs
  serviceName: fh-sync-server
...
....

## Testing

There are currently not much tools for testing. The APB team has a few open Github issues and proposals:

* link:https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/ansible-playbook-bundle/issues/131[lint command for APB content]
* link:https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/ansible-playbook-bundle/blob/master/docs/proposals/testing.md[CI and Image tests]
