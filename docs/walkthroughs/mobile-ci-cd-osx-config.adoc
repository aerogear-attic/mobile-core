This document explains how to add an external mac machine as a node (ssh agent) in Jenkins to build iOS apps.

== OSX Requirements

Required packages/tools to run ios builds:

* xcode and related tools
* java sdk
* ruby
* cocoapods
* user with enabled remote access

NOTE: Java SDK should be installed from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html[oracles official website]

Additonal packages/tools for supporting cordova apps:

* nodejs and npm
* cordova cli

== Jenkins requirements

Required jenkins plugins (already installed by mobile ci|cd service):

* xcode-plugin
* ssh-agent plugin

== Jenkins OSX Node

Now we need to add our osx node into jenkins:

Add a new node by clicking on "New Node" in the left menu:

Fill the form up with the required info:

* *Labels:* comma separated value to be used as node labels - this value can be later used by pipeline scripts
* *# of executors:* number of concurrent jobs that can be executed in this node
* *Usage:* we recommend using "Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node" so only jobs that specify this node specific label will be executed in this node
* *Remote Root directory:* it is recommended to use the users home folder to avoid permission issues

You can now save your node config and click on "re-launch node" (this may take a while depending on the nodes network speed).

You should now see your osx node in your node list:

=== Environment Variables


You will need to set some environment variables in your osx Jenkins node config to make sure that the ssh agent will be able to use all the available mac node tools (you can get the value of those env vars by runnning `env` into your external mac node):

* BASH (usually `/bin/bash`)
* PATH
* LANG (usually `en_US.UTF-8)
* LC_ALL (usually `en_US.UTF-8) 
* CI (required by cordova, needs to be set to `Y`)

If using NVM:

* NVM_DIR
* NVM_BIN

If using RVM:

* rvm_bin_path
* GEM_HOME
* MY_RUBY_HOME
* rvm_path
* rvm_prefix
* GEM_PATH
