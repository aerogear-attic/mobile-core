= Mobile Client provisioning

== Overview

This document will outline how we represent your mobile client within your OpenShift project, how to create a representation and what that representation is used for.

== The Mobile client representation

This is a custom resource definition in OpenShift that allows us to give you a visual representation of your mobile client and the services it is making use of.
From within the UI as part of the mobile client, you can see which services you can bind your mobile client to, and which services your client is already bound to. You can also view the specific configuration for that client, that will allow your mobile application to communicate and integrate with these services.

== Supported platforms/types

* Android
* iOS
* Cordova
* Xamarin

=== Openshift UI

Once the installer is complete you should be able to access OpenShift at
https://192.168.37.1:8443/console/. You will need to accept the
self-signed certificate.

==== Create a new client

Under the `mobile` tab select `apps` then choose a desired platform for your client app:

Fill the client app form with the proper information:

You can check your client app status in your project now (provisioning might take a while):

===== Retrieve an existing client

You can check your client app info by going to `Applications > Provisioned Services` and selecting your client app:

===== Delete an existing client

You can delete your client app by clicking on `Actions > Delete` under the client app details:
