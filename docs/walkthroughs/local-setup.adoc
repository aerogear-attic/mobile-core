[[local-setup]]
= Local Setup

This walkthrough sets up a locally running OpenShift cluster for:

* developing Mobile Services (via APBs)
* developing the Mobile CLI
* developing the Mobile specific UI in the OpenShift Web Console

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

=== Hardware Requirements
* Please make sure that you have at least *64GiB* of free space on your filesystem
* for smooth run have 16GiB of RAM

[[tooling-requirements]]
=== Tooling Requirements (Required)

* http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html[Ansible]
>= 2.3.2.0
* https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub account]
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Docker]
* https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] >= 6.10.0
* `libselinux-python` package (Linux only)
* https://brew.sh[Homebrew] >= 1.3.6 (Mac only)

[[firewall-requirements]]
=== Firewall Requirements (Required)

. Configure the Docker registry _and_ ports required as part
of the cluster setup:
+
* Linux: Follow steps 2 _and_ 3
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md#linux[here]
* Mac: Follow steps 2 _and_ 3
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md#macos-with-docker-for-mac[here]

. For Linux (Fedora) we also need to add an extra port to the `dockerc`
zone:
+
[source,sh]
----
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone dockerc --add-port 443/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
----

[[creating-a-local-cluster]]
== Creating a Local Cluster

[[clone-this-repository]]
=== Clone this repository

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-core
----

[[install-the-required-ansible-dependencies]]
=== Install the required ansible dependencies:

[source,sh]
----
cd mobile-core
ansible-galaxy install -r ./installer/requirements.yml
----
*Note:* If you encounter a permission error for files under `/etc/ansible/roles/` this is because non-root user does not have write access to the default ansible roles folder.
You can either:

* Allow write access to `/etc/ansible/roles/`
* Run the above command with `--roles-path ./installer/roles/`

[[run-the-ansible-installer]]
=== Run the Ansible Installer

The installer sets up your OpenShift environment with the service catalog and the OpenShift Ansible Broker (OAB).
To run the ansible installer directly and specify any property values:

[source,sh]
----
export DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=<my_dockerhub_username>
export DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD=<my_dockerhub_password>
ansible-playbook ./installer/playbook.yml -e "dockerhub_username=$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME" -e "dockerhub_password=$DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD"
----

Alternatively, to run a script that prompts for property values:

[source,sh]
----
./installer/install.sh
----

A DockerHub username and password are currently required because the
OpenShift Ansible Broker (OAB) calls Docker APIs to read/load Ansible Playbook
Bundles from a Docker Hub organisation (defaults to `aerogear`).

NOTE: If the installer fails, run
`make clean` in the repo home directory before running the installer again.

NOTE: If the installer hangs for a really long time or crashes on `oc cluster up` step, check free-space on your filesystem.

*Optional*

You can enable Hawkular metrics by passing `-e 'hawkular_metrics=true'`
as part of your `ansible-playbook` command.

[[local-ui-development]]
== Local UI Development

For developing the OpenShift UI locally, see link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-core/blob/master/docs/walkthroughs/developing-ui-locally.adoc[this guide].

[[creating-mobile-apps]]
== Creating Mobile Apps

Once the installer is complete you should be able to access OpenShift at
https://192.168.37.1:8443/console/. You will need to accept the
self-signed certificate.

You can login using `developer` and any password.

Once logged in you should be presented with a `catalog` of services.
To create your first Mobile App:

. Choose the `Mobile` category & `Apps` sub-category.
. Choose `Android App`
. Fill in the required information and continue through the wizard.
. The App should appear in the 'Mobile Applications' section of the Project Overview screen
