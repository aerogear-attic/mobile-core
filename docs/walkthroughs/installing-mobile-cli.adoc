= Setting up the Mobile CLI

The Mobile CLI allows developers to easily consume the RedHat suite of mobile services on top of OpenShift or Kubernetes from the command line.
It may be used standalone or as a kubectl or oc plugin.

== Installing the CLI 

A list of releases available for download can be found link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-cli/releases[here].
Download the correct binary for your operating system, untar it and add the `mobile` executable to your path. 
Type `mobile -h` at the command line to verify that the CLI has been installed correctly.

Alternatively, for a more convenient way to install the Mobile CLI on Mac and Linux, use the `install.sh` script in the link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-cli/tree/master/scripts[scripts directory] of the mobile-cli repo:
```bash
./install [version]
```
If a version is not specified, the script will default to the latest release. 

== Setting up as a kubectl or oc plugin
* Make sure the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl] or link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#installing-the-cli[oc command line tool] is installed
* Make sure the Mobile CLI binary has been added to your path
* Create a new directory for the plugin: 
```
mkdir -p ~/.kube/plugins/mobile
```

* Copy the `cli_plugin.yaml` file from the link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-cli/tree/master/scripts[artifacts] folder of the mobile-cli repo into the plugin folder as `plugin.yaml`:
```bash
cp ./artifacts/cli_plugin.yaml ~/.kube/plugins/mobile/plugin.yaml
```

You should now be able to use the mobile CLI as a plugin with `kubectl` or `oc`:

```bash
kubectl plugin mobile <command>
oc plugin mobile <command>
```

== Developing the CLI
See the link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-cli/blob/master/README.md[README] for instructions on how to develop the CLI locally.
